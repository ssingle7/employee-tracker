# employee-tracker

The purpose of this employee tracker application was to build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. This interface will allow non-developers to view and interact with information stored in a database. As a business owner, view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that you can organize and plan your business.

* The database schema was designed containing three tables: department, role, and employee.

* A command-line application that allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

* Used the MySQL package NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries. 

* Used the Inquirer JS NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Used the console.table to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.
